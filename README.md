# A Flappy Bird Clone
Made with P5.js... that's it.

Most of the assets and some of the logic was adapted from Tech With Tim's [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMxFDaIOHsE&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-lwGZWXz5Qgta_YNX3_vLS2&t=0s). Some P5.js code was adapted from Coding Train's [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXgA1d_E-jY). 

To run code - clone to local machine and open index.html in a live server or any browsers will do.
